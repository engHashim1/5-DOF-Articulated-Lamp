# 5-DOF-Articulated-Lamp
This project features a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) articulated lamp designed in Tinkercad. It demonstrates how to create and visualize multiple pivoting and rotating joints in a 3D model, making it an ideal educational tool for understanding mechanical linkages and basic robotics principles.
