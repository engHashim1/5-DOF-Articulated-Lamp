# 5-DOF-Articulated-RoboticARM

## Description
This project features a 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) articulated RoboticARM designed in Tinkercad. It demonstrates how to create and visualize multiple pivoting and rotating joints in a 3D model, making it an ideal educational tool for understanding mechanical linkages and basic robotics principles.

The Arm consists of:
- A rotating base allowing yaw movement.
- Two pivoting joints in the arm providing pitch control.
- A wrist rotation joint enabling the ARM head to rotate.
- A tilt joint on the Arm head to adjust its angle independently.

---

## Features
- **5 DOF** including base rotation, two elbow-like arm pivots, wrist rotation, and Arm head tilt.
- Built entirely in Tinkercad using basic geometric shapes.
- Color-coded components for easy identification of joints and segments.
- Flexible design suitable as a prototype for physical builds or 3D printing experiments.

## How to Build / Modify
1. Open [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com).
2. Create a new 3D design.
3. Assemble components using cylinders and boxes to create segments, pivots, and Arm head.
4. Group and align parts carefully to simulate realistic joints.
5. Use the color tool to visually distinguish different segments and joints.

## Potential Improvements
- Add animation in more advanced software (e.g., Fusion 360) to simulate movement.
- Incorporate servo mounts or mechanical constraints for physical prototyping.
- Add wiring channels or paths for actual LEDs if you intend to 3D print the arm.
